        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there!
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! I'm a full-stack developer at Bajaj Finserv with a passion for crafting beautiful, functional software solutions using the mean stack. I graduated from BITS Pilani and love a good coding challenge. When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me honing my football skills, strumming on my guitar, or working up a sweat at the gym. I'm fascinated by the mysteries of outer space and often draw inspiration from the stars. Join me on a journey to explore the far reaches of the digital cosmos and beyond!

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          The Pilani AtmaNirbahr Resource Center Website is a fully functional and user-friendly platform developed during my internship at the non-profit organization. The website aims to help the poor and needy people of Pilani find suitable government schemes. It features a well-organized scheme directory with information about upcoming and relevant government schemes, categorized based on eligibility criteria. Users can explore the schemes, learn about their benefits, and access details on application procedures. The platform also enables users to post queries related to the schemes, seeking clarifications or guidance. To ensure prompt assistance, we integrated an efficient admin panel where administrators can respond to user queries and maintain transparency. The website's user authentication and privacy measures safeguard sensitive data. With a responsive design, the website remains accessible on various devices, facilitating easy access to essential resources and support for the local community. The project has had a significant impact, empowering individuals to avail themselves of vital benefits and fostering self-reliance.        </p>
